So you have multiple devices with the same I2C hex address but want to use them on the same bus? 

Impossible! Or is it? Using this TCA9548A I2C multiplexer you can do it with no problem and minimal coding. Just one extra line of code in your Arduino sketch and you'll be able to use up to 8 devices with the same hex address.

And there's more! The devices you hang off this multiplexer can be at a different voltage to the µController voltage (which is the same voltage you will be supplying to this device). In fact, *each* device can be a different voltage. How's that for flexibility?

I show you exactly how to scan for your I2C devices (in case you don't know the hex address of the devices) and then show how I can update two LCD units with the same 0x3F address.
